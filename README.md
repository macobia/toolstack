Motivation
Creating simple tools with LLMs is not only easy—it’s genuinely fun and feels like a no-brainer. This project explores the long-term value of what I call “vibe coding.” Every tool here is built entirely by LLMs, without a single line of manually written code.

The aim is to build a collection of tools I personally use—often replacing buggy or sketchy websites—with a focus on privacy (everything runs in your browser), simplicity (no build steps, just pure HTML/CSS/JS), and good vibes all around.
