## âœ¨ Motivation

Creating simple tools with LLMs is not only easyâ€”itâ€™s genuinely fun and feels like a no-brainer.

This project is built on the philosophy of **vibe coding**: letting LLMs generate clean, functional tools that I use day-to-day. No sketchy or ad-filled websites. No invasive tracking. Just fast, minimal tools that work.

Everything in this repository is:

- Built entirely by LLMs (without manually written code)
- Designed to be privacy-friendly (runs entirely in your browser)
- Simple and dependency-free (pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
- Focused on real-world utility

Over time, Iâ€™ll continue to add new tools to this repositoryâ€”everything I personally need or use.
